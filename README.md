I’m interested in learning about automation and scripting and how I can use scripting at work for efficiency for myself and my team.<br></br>
I'm currently a jack-of-all-trades admin overseeing systems/server, network, and security administration. However I am pursuing and looking to pivoting into cybersecurity, specifically offensive security.<br></br>
I’m currently using and/or learning Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Powershell, and Bash.<br></br>
I utilize CTF's to give me real-world experience writing scripts and using that knowledge to review and reverse engineer source code.<br></br>
I’m looking to collaborate on learning more about scripting and programming and how it relates to the overall aspect of offensive security.
