Hello!<br></br>
I'm currently a jack-of-all-trades Senior System Administrator overseeing systems/server, network, and security administration. My day-to-day includes technical advising to juniors, administering our network and systems, and overseeing the security posture.<br></br>
I’m currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science degree from Western Governor's University.<br></br>
In my free time I like to compete in CTF's and obtain as much knowledge as I can about pen testing and red teaming.<br></br>
Let's connect if you're in that realm as well!
