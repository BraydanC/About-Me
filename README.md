Hello!<br></br>
I'm currently a jack-of-all-trades Senior System Administrator overseeing systems/server, network, and security administration. My day-to-day includes technical advising to juniors, administering our network and systems, and overseeing the security posture.<br></br>
I’m currently pursuing my Bachelors of Science in Network Engineering and Security degree from Western Governor's University.<br></br>
In my free time I like to compete in CTF's and continuously learn about security engineering, offensive security, web app security.<br></br>
