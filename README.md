I’m interested in learning about automation and scripting and how I can use scripting at work for efficiency for myself and my team.<br></br>
I'm currently a jack-of-all-trades admin overseeing systems/server, network, and security administration. However I am pursuing my core passion and looking to pivot into cybersecurity, specifically offensive security.<br></br>
I’m currently using and/or learning Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Powershell, and Bash.<br></br>
I compete in CTF's to give me real-world experience with offensive security and writing scripts, and using that knowledge to review and reverse engineer source code and continue learning.<br></br>
I’m looking to collaborate on learning more about scripting and programming and how I can use it to become a better asset for offensive security.
